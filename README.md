# üì° Free Space vs Two-Ray Ground Reflection Path Loss Models

This project simulates and compares two fundamental wireless propagation models:

- **Free Space Path Loss (FSPL)**
- **Two-Ray Ground Reflection Model**

It visualizes how the received power changes with distance using both models and marks the **breakpoint distance**, beyond which two-ray behavior dominates.

## üìò Theory Overview

### 1. Free Space Path Loss (FSPL)

The FSPL model assumes ideal line-of-sight propagation without obstacles or reflections.

#### Formula:

![FSPL formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_{fs}(dB)%20%3D%2020%20%5Clog_{10}(d)%20%2B%2020%20%5Clog_{10}(f)%20-%20147.55)

The power-based form used in this program:

![Power-based FSPL](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_r%20%3D%20P_t%20%5Ccdot%20G_t%20%5Ccdot%20G_r%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Clambda%7D%7B4%5Cpi%20d%7D%5Cright)%5E2)

Where:  
- \(P_r\): Received power (W)  
- \(P_t\): Transmit power (W)  
- \(G_t, G_r\): Antenna gains (unitless)  
- \(\lambda = \frac{c}{f}\): Wavelength (m)  
- \(d\): Distance between transmitter and receiver (m)

### 2. Two-Ray Ground Reflection Model

This model accounts for both the direct and ground-reflected signals, better modeling propagation over longer distances.

#### Formula:

![Two-Ray formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_r%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BP_t%20%5Ccdot%20G_t%20%5Ccdot%20G_r%20%5Ccdot%20h_t%5E2%20%5Ccdot%20h_r%5E2%7D%7Bd%5E4%7D)

Where:  
- \(h_t, h_r\): Transmit and receive antenna heights (m)

---

### 3. Breakpoint Distance

The breakpoint distance marks where the model shifts from FSPL behavior to two-ray model behavior.

#### Formula:

![Breakpoint formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d_{break}%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B4%20%5Ccdot%20h_t%20%5Ccdot%20h_r%7D%7B%5Clambda%7D)

Beyond \(d_{break}\), the received power drops off faster (‚àù \(1/d^4\)) compared to FSPL (‚àù \(1/d^2\)).
